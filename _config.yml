  Hi, my name is Zhidan Luo. I'm a master student in the Computer Engineering department at the University of Virginia (UVA).<br/>
  
  I have completed my undergraduate in Electronic and Electrical Engineering both from University of Glasgow (UoG) 
  and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My undergraduate thesis supervisor was 
  [Dr. Wasim Ahmad](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/wasimahmad/#).<br/>
  
  In my spare time, I really enjoy travelling with my girl fridend [Xin](https://www.instagram.com/devil_mx16/), 
  especially we having fun in **Disney World** and **Universal Studios**.
